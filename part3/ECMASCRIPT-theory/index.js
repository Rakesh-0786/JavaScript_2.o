/*
ECMAScript is a scripting language specification that
 serves as the standard for scripting languages like JavaScript,
  JScript, and ActionScript. It defines the rules, syntax, 
  and features that a scripting language should implement. 
  ECMAScript is maintained by the Ecma International 
  standards organization, and each new version adds new features 
  and improvements.

Key Points about ECMAScript:

Versions: ECMAScript has several versions, starting from ES1 (ECMAScript 1) to the latest versions like ES2020 and ES2021. Each version introduces new features and syntax improvements.
Standardization: The main purpose of ECMAScript is to ensure that different implementations of JavaScript are consistent and work the same way across various environments, such as browsers and servers.
Popular Features: Some well-known features introduced in recent versions include arrow functions, classes, modules, promises, async/await, and more. 
The full form of ECMA is European Computer Manufacturers Association. However, the organization has been rebranded as Ecma International. It is an industry association dedicated to standardizing information and communication systems, including the ECMAScript language specification, which forms the basis for languages like JavaScript.
