JavaScript does indeed support object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and it does have classes. While JavaScript's class system was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the language itself uses prototypes for inheritance and object creation. The class syntax provides a more familiar and traditional way to define and work with objects and inheritance, especially for those coming from class-based languages like Java or C#.

What is a programming Paradigm?
Programming paradigm is a way or style of  writing the code or program.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design and implement software. It organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core concepts and principles of OOP:

In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with a predefined structure and behavior. Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), classes provide a more familiar and concise syntax for defining and working with objects and inheritance compared to JavaScript's traditional prototype-based approach.

Key Features of JavaScript Classes
Class Definition: A class is defined using the class keyword. It typically includes a constructor method and other methods that define the behavior of instances created from the class.

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;  // Instance property
    this.age = age;    // Instance property
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}
Constructor: The constructor method is a special method for initializing new objects created from the class. It is automatically called when a new instance is created using the new keyword.

javascript
Copy code
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(person1.greet());  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
Methods: You can define methods within a class to add behavior to objects created from the class.

javascript
Copy code
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  start() {
    console.log('Engine started');
  }

  drive() {
    console.log('Driving the car');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
myCar.start();  // Output: Engine started
myCar.drive();  // Output: Driving the car
