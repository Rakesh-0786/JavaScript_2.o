// do while means it first doing the iteraction one and then 
// The do-while loop is another type of loop control statement that is used to repeatedly execute a block of code. It is similar to the while loop but has a key difference: the do-while loop guarantees that the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition.

let i=2;
do{
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while(i<5);
